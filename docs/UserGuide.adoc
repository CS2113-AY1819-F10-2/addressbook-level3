== 1 Introduction
The MediBook v1.3 allows healthcare professionals to keep track of patients’ details, arrange their schedule based on their patients’ appointments and communicate efficiently between colleagues.

== 2 About
This user guide provides an overview for healthcare professionals on the usage of MediBook once MediBook is set up.

However, setting up this MediBook requires basic familiarity with integrated developer environment (IDE) as there is no user-friendly installer. Please seek help from the technician staff or refer to the <<DeveloperGuide#setting-up, Setting up>> section to learn how to set up the project.

== 3 Starting the program

. Find the project pane (usually located at the left side)
. Open up `src/seedu.addressbook` folder
. Right click on `Main`
. Click `Run Main.main()`
. The GUI should appear in a few seconds
. Enter "Username" in the username field and "Password" in the password field according to the prompts
. Upon successful login, GUI `Welcome to MediBook` will appear.
. If incorrect username and password is entered, both fields will be cleared and you can try logging in again.
//ignore: program will exit upon login failure, i.e. 3 incorrect username/password tries
