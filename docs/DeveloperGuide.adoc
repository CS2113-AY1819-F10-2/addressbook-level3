== 1 Introduction
The Health Booklet v1.2 is an application that function as an advance logbook for in healthcare settings. It allows healthcare professionals to keep track of patients’ details, arrange their schedule based on their patients’ appointments and communicate efficiently between colleagues through instant messaging.

This Developer Guide is intended for users with basic technical background as it details the setting up of our application, the design of our software architecture, describe the implementation of our key features, and the testing involved in our software. Appendix includes user stories and use case for reference.


== 2 Setting up

=== Prerequisites

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE

=== Importing the project into IntelliJ

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` class (right-click the `Main` class and click `Run Main.main()`) and try executing a few commands
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`) and ensure that they pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=java.xml.bind' to module compiler options`

== 4. Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== 4.1  State control (undo/redo)
The state control feature allows the user to manipulate the different states of the Health Booklet in the current session with the undo and redo command. This section will describe the implementation of this feature.

==== 4.1.1  Current implementation

The state control mechanism is managed by the CommandHistory class. It stores the various states of the Health Booklet in an arraylist `*addressBookStates*` with the `*stateIterator*` pointing to the latest state in the `*addressBookStates*`.

*The following core methods are in place to assist in the mechanism:*

* `*saveInitialState()*`- Saves the initial state of the Health Booklet state on start-up in addressBookStates. +
* `*addCurrentState()*`- Saves the current Health Booklet state in addressBookStates and move the stateIterator forward. +
* `*undoLast()*`- Restores the previous Health Booklet state from addressBookStates. +
* `*redoLast()*`- Restores a previously undone Health Booklet state from addressBookStates. +
* `*truncateOldPath()*`- Remove Health Booklet states from addressBookStates following a change made after undo-ing. (will be discussed in more details below) +
* `*checkForAction()*`- Check whether the truncateOldPath() method needs to be called before calling addCurrentState(). +

*Below is an example usage scenario and the behaviours of the component at a given time:*

(Diagrams will be added in the future for better visualisation of this section.)

*1. On start-up:*

CommandHistory will be initialised with the initial state of the Health Booklet with `*saveInitialState()*` and the `*stateIterator*` will be initialised to 0.

*2. User executes a command that make changes to the Health Booklet (e.g add John Doe...):*

The `add` command calls `*CommandHistory.checkForAction()*` which will determine whether this command was made following an `undo` command and therefore requires `*truncateOldPath()*` to be called (in this case it won't be called). After which the `*addCurrentState()*` method will be called, which moves the `*stateIterator*` forward from 0 to 1 and saves the current Health Booklet state in `*addressBookStates*` arraylist.

Note: `*CommandHistory.checkForAction()*` will only be called if the command has been executed successfully. If it fails its execution, the Health Booklet state will not be saved into the `*addressBookStates*`.

*3. User wants to undo the change they just made and executes the `undo` command:*

The undo command calls `*CommandHistory.undoLast()*` which will move the `*stateIterator*` from 1 to 0 and restores the Health Booklet state stored in `*addressBookStates[0]*`.

Note: If the user execute `undo` command when the `*stateIterator*` is at 0, the `*undoLast()*` method will throw a `*HistoryOutOfBoundException()*` which will be caught in the UndoCommand class and will display an error to the user instead.

*4. User executes another command that make changes to the Health Booklet after the undo (e.g delete 1):*

The `delete` command calls `*CommandHistory.checkForAction()*` which determines that this command was made following an `undo` command and therefore requires `*truncateOldPath()*` to be called. In this case, all states saved in the `*addressBookStates*` after index 0 will be cleared and will be unable to redone. After which the `*addCurrentState()*` method will be called, which moves the `*stateIterator*` forward from 0 to 1 and saves the current Health Booklet state in `*addressBookStates*` arraylist.

==== 4.1.2  Reason for this implementation
Storing the different states of the Health Booklet is relatively easy to implement and it is less prone to errors. However, a drawback for this implementation is the high memory usage required which might cause performance issues.

==== 4.1.3  Alternative consideration
An alternative to the current implementation is to save the list of commands executed in the arraylist instead of the whole Health Booklet and reverse them when attempting to undo. However, this requires implemented class to know how to reverse each command. For example, undo-ing a `delete` command requires the class to perform `add` and the class has to remember all the arguments required to create the same person that was deleted.

=== 4.2 Login System
Securely logs user on to Health Booklet

==== 4.2.1 Current Implementation
Login is implemented before the main GUI launches. Upon the launch of Health Booklet, Health Booklet prompts for two input from the User, username and password. Health Booklet then compares the given pair of inputs with loginstorage.txt.

loginstorage.txt stores the username of all users and the hashes of their passwords. Health Booklet iterates through loginstorage.txt to find the matching username, and the corresponding hashed password. The password entered is hashed using Java’s SHA-512 hashing algorithm. The result is then matched with the hash stored in loginstorage.txt, if both matches then login is successful and user is allowed into Health Booklet. If they do not match, then the program is terminated.

==== 4.2.2 Reason for this implementation
There is no need to open the GUI, if User fails to log in, thus login is implemented before the GUI launches.
To ensure a secure Health Booklet, user login profiles must be stored securely. Storing the hash result instead of the password ensures that should loginstorage.txt be compromised, the actual passwords are still unknown to the perpetrators.

==== 4.2.3 Alternative consideration
Java Authentication and Authorisation System (JAAS) was also considered when deciding on how to implement Health Booklet’s login system. However, using JAAS is more restrictive than the current implementation which allows for easy change in hashing algorithms used and different security features in the future. JAAS is also harder to implement and as Health Booklet is currently targeted at about 1000 users, there is no need to use JAAS.


=== 4.3 Scheduling
Scheduling allows appointment to be stored in Health Booklet. The Health Booklet recognise a schedule date with the tag 'd/'.

==== 4.3.1 Current Implementation
The schedule feature currently accepts dates from the users as an input category under the add command. Input must be in the format DD-MM-YYYY for it to be accepted as a proper schedule date input. For each person added, multiple schedule dates can be added and it is also not a compulsory field to fill.

This is achieved by setting up a schedule class which sets a regular expression (regex) that only accept valid dates in the DD-MM-YYYY format. Non-existent dates such as 30-02-2019 or 28-28-2019 would not be accepted.

Subsequently, a hashset of schedule act as an attribute for person class. Every time the add command is used to add a valid person, a person object is created with the set of schedule as part of the attribute of the person. As such, there can be multiple appointment dates added together with the person. The schedule is identified using the ‘d/’ mark.

==== 4.3.2 Reason for Implementation
Due to the large number of patients the doctors care for, it is at times hard to keep track of the numerous appointments made by their patients. As such, a scheduling feature would record the appointment date so that they can keep track of the numerous appointments they have for the day.

==== 4.3.3 Future/Alternative Implementation
In future versions, the following details would be slowly incremented to ensure a smooth user experience while using the scheduling feature of Health Booklet.

. Edit the appointment dates only.
. A command to view all or list the appointments in a chronological order following the reference date.
. A doctor can view their respective patients appointment

==== 4.4 Instant Messaging
Once fully implemented, users will be able to chat over the internet using a separate chat client.

Instant messaging is implemented using a Swing-based client for the chat server.
Graphically it is a frame with a text field for entering messages and a text area to see the whole dialog.
The client follows the Chat Protocol which is as follows.

When the server sends "SUBMITNAME" the client replies with the desired screen name.  The server will keep sending "SUBMITNAME" requests as long as the client submits screen names that are already in use.
When the server sends a line beginning with "NAMEACCEPTED" the client is now allowed to startsending the server arbitrary strings to be broadcast to all chatters connected to the server.
When the server sends a line beginning with "MESSAGE " then all characters following this string should be displayed in its message area.

== 5.Testing
Testing the Health Booklet is important as it verifies that the Health Booklet is functioning and up-to-date. This can be done so by going into IntelliJ, right-click on the test folder and choose Run 'All Tests'.
