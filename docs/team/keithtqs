== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 3

---

== Overview
MediBook is adapted from Software Engineering Education’s (SE-EDU) AddressBook Level 3 application and it has been designed specifically for healthcare professionals. It contains approximately three thousand lines of code (LoC) and it is written in an object-oriented programming (OOP) fashion of the Java programming language.

== Summary of contributions

Together with my project group mates, Xi Yi, Nicholas and Jia Jian, MediBook was born. The following is a summary of my contributions.

* *Major enhancement*: *MediChat* - allows instant messaging between healthcare professionals
** What it does:
*** Allows users to send messages instantly in a chatroom for multiple users to view
*** View previously sent messages after logging back in (coming soon)
*** Opens in a separate window so that users can continue working in MediBook without the need to close MediChat
** Justification:
*** Healthcare professionals are often overloaded and thus do not have time to spend on email threads which are confusing.
*** Colleagues might also get accidentally left out receiving the carbon copy and thus cause a communication breakdown.
*** Although there are instant messaging channels already available such as WhatsApp and Telegram, MediChat is meant to be used within the facility’s network so that there is minimal risk of a data breach.
** Highlights:
*** As instant messaging channels are readily available already, there is little documentation available regarding the implementation of this feature.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])
** Documentation:
*** Did cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project (https://github.com[#42])
*** Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
